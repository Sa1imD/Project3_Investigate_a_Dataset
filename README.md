# Project3_Investigate_a_Dataset

## Introduction

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.
- The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
- The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.


Question 1: What is the general trend for purchasing handgun, long gun, and others from 1998 to 2017 for each month?

Question 2: What is the prevalence of owned firms? and where is the highest percentage for each category of firms in 2012?

Question 3: Which are the states have highest and less median value of owner-occupied housing units from 2011 to 2015  compared to the population in percent?

## Conclusions

> Through this analysis, we have gained insight into the general concept. By examining the data, we have been able to track gun acquisition patterns for several years. Our examination yielded significant results for the months with the highest amounts of gun purchases. Where we can conclude that recent years have witnessed a significant rise in the trend of buying guns of all kinds, which helps the FBI to benefit from data more than a criminal background check.
>
> We were also able to determine the spread of owned companies of several types in the United States for the year 2012, which provides an overview of the market and investment opportunities in each state, and we also analyzed the median value of owner-occupied housing units during the period from 2011 to 2015, which also gives an overview and benefit in real estate investment in each state.

## limitation 

> One of the main limitations is the limited data of the census of owned firms as the attached census is for 2012 only. It is worth noting that such data is subject to change on an annual basis and helps more for the desired purpose.
>
> As for NICS data, the presence of a lot of missing data, which we replaced with the average to create a close value, from my own point of view, the missing values of such sensitive data create uncertainty in the trends of owning guns, where more accurate data gives more clarity to the places of their spread of various kinds.
